<p> 
My name is Heather Marsh. I am the Librarian/Media Specialist at Carroll County Middle School in picturesque Carrollton, Kentucky. I have served in this position since 2023. Prior to that, I worked as a Special Education teacher. I began my carrier in education in 2006 working as a teacher for Owen County Schools as an FMD teacher for three years. Thereafter, I transferred to Gallatin County Schools, where I served as an FMD teacher for one year. I took a ten year sabbatical from education to work at my favorite job as a stay-at-home mom. After my daughter went to Kindergarten, I returned to education as an LBD teacher at Trimble County Schools. After three years in Trimble County, I transferred to Carroll County Middle School as an LBD teacher for a year, prior to taking on the role of Librarian/Media Specialist. My passion is shaping the futures of our youth. I love helping them explore their own passions and the great big world that surrounds them.

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;"><i>Worklife...</i><br>
As the Librarian/Media Specialist at Carroll County Middle School I have worked hard to expand the offerings of our library and media center to our students. My goal is to make the library a conduit of knowledge through traditional literary methods and new, cutting-edge, hands-on experiences for our students. I believe the possibilities are endless in a library and I want my students to feel the same way. As my hero, Walt Disney said, <STRONG>"If you <b>DREAM</b> it, you can <b>DO</b> it!!!"</p>
